## Notebooks
Each Notebook has some theory and analysis with real and generated data.

- data_processing: Some rules and techniques in processing data, one of the most important task in model creation and data analysis.
- linear_regression: Model estimation with linear parameters, used with quantitative variables, very common in supervized learning.
- model_selection: It is possible to model the same data with different models, but which one is more efficient and the best?
- bayes_classifier: A family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem.
- bayes_naive_classifier: A simple case of a bayes classifier with strong (na√Øve) independence assumptions between the features.
