# Data Analysis Practice

## Notebooks
Each Notebook has some theory and analysis with real and generated data.

- data_processing: Some relues and techniques in processing data, one of the most important task in model creation and data analysis.
- linear_regression: Model estimation with linear parameters, used with quantitative variables, very common in supervized learning.
- model_selection: it is possible to model the same data with different models, but which one is more efficient and the best?
